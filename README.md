# VisionQuest: Revolutionizing Supermarket Checkouts with AI

## Team Visionaries - CSCI 4622-001

### Project Proposal: Image Classification for Streamlining Supermarket Checkouts

#### Team Members:
- Abdullah Yassine
- Jackson Sutherland
- Suman Upreti

### Problem Space
Our project aims to replace traditional barcode scanning at supermarket checkouts with an AI-powered image classification system. This system will identify and categorize fruits and vegetables, enhancing checkout efficiency and reducing microplastic pollution from barcode stickers.

### Why Machine Learning
We utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including VGG16 and InceptionV3, to develop a robust image classification system. These models are capable of recognizing complex visual patterns essential for accurate produce identification.

### Data / Data Plan
- **Dataset:** About 100,000 images across hundreds of categories, sourced primarily from the Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition Dataset on Kaggle.
- **Data Processing:** Images will undergo preprocessing to adjust for variations in lighting, alignment, and scale.
- **Outcome Variables:** Classification accuracy of each image.
- **Type of Learning:** Supervised learning, with a focus on labeled image data.

### Model Architecture and Justification
We will use the VGG16 and InceptionV3 architectures, adapted for high accuracy in diverse real-world scenarios.

### Training Methodology
Training will involve Stratified K-Fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and generalizability.

### Results and Optimization Procedures
Implementation of ModelCheckpoint will allow monitoring and saving of the best model configurations based on validation loss.

### Conclusion
VisionQuest leverages cutting-edge machine learning technologies to offer a scalable and environmentally friendly checkout solution, promising significant improvements in efficiency and waste reduction.
